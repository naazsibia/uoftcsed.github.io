abstract = {In this paper, we present our experience with the use of breakout rooms in a second year undergraduate Software Design course at a large North American institution. Following the switch to remote instruction during the coronavirus pandemic, we revamped our in-person Software Design course to be delivered as a flipped online course, making extensive use of in-lecture exercises completed during breakout rooms. We report on the structure and logistics of this lecture design (for a large class of 300+ students). To gain insights into the impact of the use of breakout rooms on student experience, we conducted weekly student surveys asking for feedback on the lectures and specifically on the use of breakout rooms. Although many students had positive feelings regarding the use of breakout rooms, a significant percentage of students (an average of 47% of the survey responses each week) expressed negative feelings toward them. In an end-of-term survey, we specifically asked students about what they felt worked best for breakout rooms in terms of group size and pre-assigned versus randomized groups, and if there were any other areas that they felt needed improvement. Some of the patterns we observed were that most students liked smaller groups (2-5 people), preferred staying in the same group throughout the semester, and enjoyed the use of breakout rooms as long as others in their room were active participants. We share the details of these survey results as well as the tips and lessons that we learned through this experience.},

abstract = {Motivation Despite the widespread belief that computing practitioners frequently experience the Imposter Phenomenon (IP), little formal work has measured the prevalence of IP in the computing community despite its negative effect on achievement.Objectives This study aims to replicate recent work that has suggested that IP experiences are widespread in computing students and to extend that work by exploring the relationship between the IP, progress in the program, and ethnic identity.Methods A survey with several demographic questions (gender, ethnicity, international status, and year of study) and Clance's IP scale (CIPS) was deployed to students in post-secondary computing courses. Correlations between demographic factors and CIPS scores were evaluated, and a linear model was constructed to explore the interaction between demographic factors of interest.Results We reaffirm that a high proportion of CS students meet the IP diagnostic criteria and that women report higher CIPS scores than men. We also present evidence that Asian students with domestic and international status report different levels of IP experiences.Discussion These findings highlight the importance – to educators at all levels – of cultivating belonging in computing communities.},

abstract = { Improving student engagement and learning within introductory Computer Science (CS1) courses has been heavily studied within CS Education (CSE) research due to their fundamental role in a student’s early experiences with learning foundational CS concepts. One issue with many CS1 courses is that the practice of standardized grading leads to limited opportunities for students to find personal relevance within school projects, which could be demotivating for beginner students. This paper examines the impact of incorporating opportunities for creative thinking into a CS1 course through the use of weekly open-ended exercises. Data was collected from 284 students in a CS1 course, where roughly half of the students completed weekly exercises which included an open-ended aspect that allowed them to make their own decisions about their projects. The other half completed similar exercises but with a specifically defined, closed-ended checklist of requirements. Although no effect on academic performance was found, an analysis of survey data collected throughout the course revealed a significant connection between open-ended exercises and increased motivation, especially in terms of confidence and satisfaction. A deeper look at each particular exercise showed variances in how motivating an exercise was based on time in the semester and structure of the exercise, revealing important lessons about the design of effective open-ended CS1 exercises. },
