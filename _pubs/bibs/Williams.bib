abstract = {Procrastination by students may lead to adverse outcomes such as a focus on completion rather than learning or even a failure to complete learning tasks. One common method for motivating students and reducing procrastination is to send reminders with hints and study strategies, but it's not clear if these messages are effective or when is the best time to send them. Randomized A/B comparisons could be used to try different reminders or alternative ideas about how best to get students to start work earlier and, crucially, to measure the impact of these interventions on behaviour. This paper describes an A/B comparison of reminder emails set in a large CS1 course at a research-focused North American university. We found evidence that the email interventions caused a higher proportion of students to attempt the online homework but did not see evidence that these particular emails got students to start early, irrespective of changes to the timing of the reminder. More broadly, these findings illustrate how to use A/B comparisons in educational settings to test ideas about how to help students, and demonstrate the value of using randomized A/B comparisons, even when evaluating actions that seem obviously beneficial, such as reminder emails.},

abstract = {Engaged preparation and study in combination with lectures are important for all courses but are particularly critical for online, hybrid, and inverted classrooms. Many instructors use online systems to deliver new course content and exercises, but students often delay assignments or game these systems (e.g., guessing on multiple-choice questions), often to the detriment of their learning. In an inverted CS1 course, many students self-reported high rates of gaming-the-system behavior, so we examine survey data to identify factors that contribute to engagement in these maladaptive behaviours. We supplement that analysis with interview data to gain a deeper understanding of the situation. We also implemented and evaluated a previously reported online intervention aimed at reducing gaming behavior. Unlike prior work, our intervention did not have a significant effect on guessing behavior. We discuss why the factors we identified might explain this result, as well as suggest future work to improve our understanding of gaming behaviours and inform the design of systems that encourage effective learning.},
