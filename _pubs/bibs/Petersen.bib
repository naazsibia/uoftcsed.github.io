abstract = {Procrastination by students may lead to adverse outcomes such as a focus on completion rather than learning or even a failure to complete learning tasks. One common method for motivating students and reducing procrastination is to send reminders with hints and study strategies, but it's not clear if these messages are effective or when is the best time to send them. Randomized A/B comparisons could be used to try different reminders or alternative ideas about how best to get students to start work earlier and, crucially, to measure the impact of these interventions on behaviour. This paper describes an A/B comparison of reminder emails set in a large CS1 course at a research-focused North American u
niversity. We found evidence that the email interventions caused a higher proportion of students to attempt the online h
omework but did not see evidence that these particular emails got students to start early, irrespective of changes to the timing of the reminder. More broadly, these findings illustrate how to use A/B comparisons in educational settings to test ideas about how to help students, and demonstrate the value of using randomized A/B comparisons, even when evaluating actions that seem obviously beneficial, such as reminder emails.},

abstract = {Engaged preparation and study in combination with lectures are important for all courses but are particularly critical for online, hybrid, and inverted classrooms. Many instructors use online systems to deliver new course content and exercises, but students often delay assignments or game these systems (e.g., guessing on multiple-choice questions), often to the detriment of their learning. In an inverted CS1 course, many students self-reported high rates of gaming-the-system behavior, so we examine survey data to identify factors that contribute to engagement in these maladaptive behaviours. We supplement that analysis with interview data to gain a deeper understanding of the situation. We also implemented and evaluated a previously reported online intervention aimed at reducing gaming behavior. Unlike prior work, our intervention did not have a significant effect on guessing behavior. We discuss why the factors we identified might explain this result, as well as suggest future work to improve our understanding of gaming behaviours and inform the design of systems that encourage effective learning.},

abstract = {We report our experience of preparing and conducting unplanned online exams in the unique half-physical, half-virtual semester of Winter 2020. The report covers four courses in a large university's computer science program, ranging from first-year to third-year. With the data generated by students taking both in-person and online exams in multiple courses, we perform analyses to evaluate the validity of the online exams (especially the unproctored ones) as an assessment of student understanding. With the fine-grained student activity data provided by the online exam platform, we are also able to investigate the patterns in student exam-taking behaviours and their correlations with student performance on the exam. In addition, we share, in detail, the tips and lessons that were learned throughout the process of designing, implementing, and hosting the online exams.},

abstract = {Mathematics is at the heart of computer science as a discipline, yet not all students appreciate the relevance and importance of mathematics in a computing degree. Recent work presented a hypothesis that a student’s career inclinations may impact their view towards the value of learning mathematics, and thus their course selections. However, empirical support for this theory has previously been limited to a single institution in which students are required to include mathematics as part of their degree. In this work, we conduct a replication study in a different institutional context where mathematics is not a strict requirement for computer science students. We find robust support for the previously hypothesized relationship between career inclinations and perceptions of mathematics, and a strongly stated desire from students that the mathematics they learn should be more clearly connected and relevant to computer science. },
