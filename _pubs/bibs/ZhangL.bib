abstract = {This study analyzes common issues in the writing of our upper-year, undergraduate computer science students in timed (e.g. tests) and untimed (e.g. longer assignment reports) scenarios. Our goal is to identify writing issues that should be addressed earlier in the CS curriculum. In collaboration with a writing specialist, we develop and fine-tune a rubric with Grammar, Conciseness, Clarity, Organization, Structure, and Formality as the main categories.  We find, in our writing samples, that grammatical issues (such as punctuation errors or run-on sentences) are common even in a setting where students have ample time to proofread. Other common issues include unclear pronoun antecedents, lacking topic sentences, and other structural and organizational issues. Moreover, we correlate the presence of these issues with the students' grades. We do not find statistically significant correlations between writing skill and grades, and the weak correlations we find depend heavily on the writing context.  We hope that our rubric items and findings are useful for instructors in targeting writing skills that warrant development.},

abstract = {Motivation Despite the widespread belief that computing practitioners frequently experience the Imposter Phenomenon (IP), little formal work has measured the prevalence of IP in the computing community despite its negative effect on achievement.Objectives This study aims to replicate recent work that has suggested that IP experiences are widespread in computing students and to extend that work by exploring the relationship between the IP, progress in the program, and ethnic identity.Methods A survey with several demographic questions (gender, ethnicity, international status, and year of study) and Clance's IP scale (CIPS) was deployed to students in post-secondary computing courses. Correlations between demographic factors and CIPS scores were evaluated, and a linear model was constructed to explore the interaction between demographic factors of interest.Results We reaffirm that a high proportion of CS students meet the IP diagnostic criteria and that women report higher CIPS scores than men. We also present evidence that Asian students with domestic and international status report different levels of IP experiences.Discussion These findings highlight the importance – to educators at all levels – of cultivating belonging in computing communities.},
