abstract = {Embedding ethics modules in computer science (CS) courses is an approach to post-secondary ethics education that has been gaining traction. In contrast to dedicated courses on ethics in CS, embedding ethics modules into CS courses supports tight connections between ethical considerations and CS concepts, as well as enabling repeated exposure to ethics across multiple courses. Initial studies of the effectiveness of such modules suggest that this approach can increase both student interest in ethics and technology, and student self-efficacy towards incorporating ethical considerations in their computing work. Departments wishing to deploy embedded ethics (EE) modules need to decide how to invest resources, including class time, to maximize effectiveness while maintaining curriculum objectives. Such considerations include the number of EE module experiences a student has throughout their degree program, as well as the spacing of those experiences.Research to date has focused on the effect of a single embedded ethics module. In this paper, we report on a study examining the impact of experiencing EE modules in multiple courses. Among our findings, our results suggest that more is not necessarily better --- that a modest number of periodic exposures to EE modules over the course of a degree program may be sufficient to achieve sustained positive attitudes and self-efficacy among students. While a picture is beginning to emerge, these results highlight the need for further research on the effectiveness of embedded ethics programs as a whole.},
