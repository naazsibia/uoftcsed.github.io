abstract = {This study analyzes common issues in the writing of our upper-year, undergraduate computer science students in timed (e.g. tests) and untimed (e.g. longer assignment reports) scenarios. Our goal is to identify writing issues that should be addressed earlier in the CS curriculum. In collaboration with a writing specialist, we develop and fine-tune a rubric with Grammar, Conciseness, Clarity, Organization, Structure, and Formality as the main categories.  We find, in our writing samples, that grammatical issues (such as punctuation errors or run-on sentences) are common even in a setting where students have ample time to proofread. Other common issues include unclear pronoun antecedents, lacking topic sentences, and other structural and organizational issues. Moreover, we correlate the presence of these issues with the students' grades. We do not find statistically significant correlations between writing skill and grades, and the weak correlations we find depend heavily on the writing context.  We hope that our rubric items and findings are useful for instructors in targeting writing skills that warrant development.},

abstract = {With the shift to online delivery, instructors looked to provide comparable help supports for students, especially for first-year learners who need timely assistance the most. Our work aims to understand student help seeking behavior and perception of getting help in an online CS2 course.First, we analyze how much students ask for help and perceive to get help in several help support components: lectures, labs, instructor office hours, and on the discussion board. We find that while students take advantage of all help resources, the discussion board is predominantly the main source of help, while instructor office hours run into scalability problems. Secondly, we explore whether asking for and getting help are correlated with grades and find an inverted-U quadratic relationship in both cases. This indicates that low-performing and high-performing students ask for the least help and perceive to get the least help in each of the help support components. Finally, in each help context, we investigate which categories of questions students seek help the most with, and who students rely on most for help.Our analysis is intended to help educators better understand how to support first-year students in an online course and we hope that our findings are also useful for help support planning once in-person learning resumes.},

abstract = {Most active learning methods aim to engage students in collaborative problem-solving. While active learning and collaboration benefits are indisputable, more investigation is needed to understand student engagement in group activities. This qualitative study investigates the student perspective on group work in a CS2 inverted classroom, to better understand the learner mindset and identify potential barriers or conduits for collaborative engagement. We conducted 30-45 minute interviews with 30 participants from six sections of CS2, with five sections being scheduled in an Active Learning Classroom (ALC) and one in a traditional lecture hall, all taught in the same inverted model and using the same in-class activities. A multitude of facets of student behavior or engagement in group work and interactions with peers were identified via emergent coding. We classified emerging themes into higher-order categories which subsume semantically-related themes, forming a hierarchy with the top-level categories being Perceived Utility and Social Environment. This classification is intended to provide insight to educators seeking to better engage students in active learning via collaborative in-class activities.},

abstract = {We report our experience of preparing and conducting unplanned online exams in the unique half-physical, half-virtual semester of Winter 2020. The report covers four courses in a large university's computer science program, ranging from first-year to third-year. With the data generated by students taking both in-person and online exams in multiple courses, we perform analyses to evaluate the validity of the online exams (especially the unproctored ones) as an assessment of student understanding. With the fine-grained student activity data provided by the online exam platform, we are also able to investigate the patterns in student exam-taking behaviours and their correlations with student performance on the exam. In addition, we share, in detail, the tips and lessons that were learned throughout the process of designing, implementing, and hosting the online exams.},
