abstract = {Most active learning methods aim to engage students in collaborative problem-solving. While active learning and collaboration benefits are indisputable, more investigation is needed to understand student engagement in group activities. This qualitative study investigates the student perspective on group work in a CS2 inverted classroom, to better understand the learner mindset and identify potential barriers or conduits for collaborative engagement. We conducted 30-45 minute interviews with 30 participants from six sections of CS2, with five sections being scheduled in an Active Learning Classroom (ALC) and one in a traditional lecture hall, all taught in the same inverted model and using the same in-class activities. A multitude of facets of student behavior or engagement in group work and interactions with peers were identified via emergent coding. We classified emerging themes into higher-order categories which subsume semantically-related themes, forming a hierarchy with the top-level categories being Perceived Utility and Social Environment. This classification is intended to provide insight to educators seeking to better engage students in active learning via collaborative in-class activities.},

abstract = {We report our experience of preparing and conducting unplanned online exams in the unique half-physical, half-virtual semester of Winter 2020. The report covers four courses in a large university's computer science program, ranging from first-year to third-year. With the data generated by students taking both in-person and online exams in multiple courses, we perform analyses to evaluate the validity of the online exams (especially the unproctored ones) as an assessment of student understanding. With the fine-grained student activity data provided by the online exam platform, we are also able to investigate the patterns in student exam-taking behaviours and their correlations with student performance on the exam. In addition, we share, in detail, the tips and lessons that were learned throughout the process of designing, implementing, and hosting the online exams.},
