abstract = {Transitioning from block-based programming environments to text-based programming environments can be challenging as it requires students to learn new programming language concepts. In this paper, we identify and classify the issues encountered when transitioning from block-based to text-based programming. In particular, we investigate differences that emerge in learners when using a structured editor compared to an unstructured editor. We followed 26 high school students (ages 12-16; M=14 years) as they transitioned from Scratch to Python in three phases: (i) learning Scratch, (ii) transitioning from Scratch to Python using either a structured or unstructured editor, and (iii) evaluating Python coding skills using an unstructured editor. We identify 27 distinct types of issues and show that learners who used a structured editor during the transition phase had 4.6x less syntax issues and 1.9x less data-type issues compared to those who did not. When these learners switched to an unstructured editor for evaluation, they kept a lower rate on data-type issues but faced 4x more syntax errors.},
