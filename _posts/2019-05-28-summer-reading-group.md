In the summer term, the CS education reading group will be meeting at UTM (and on skype) at 3:00 on Tuesdays. We welcome your participation. Please check <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16PgE1p6MxLutYTAMsFZW0XMyBRdJi3vJlC6kc5xZkMk/edit#gid=0">the schedule</a> for location and paper titles.

The group may be of particular interest to students who are looking to get involved in research at U of T (whether or not that research is in computing education), but even if you aren't thinking of graduate school, this is an opportunity to practice close reading of technical material and to get a glimpse of what research is like. Please contact Andrew Petersen if you'd like to get on the mailing list for locations and papers.
